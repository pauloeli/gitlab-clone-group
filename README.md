# gitlab-clone-group

> **Based on [adroste/gitlab-clone-group](https://github.com/adroste/gitlab-clone-group)**

Python script to clone all GitLab projects of a group and their subgroups while keeping the tree structure. Tested with
GitLab API v4.

I found problems in some structures, where list generated by groups don't show some projects (I don't know why). So, I
get all projects which user have permission and make a filter. It's not so performative, but I get all I want.

Python isn't my first language, so make comfortable to improve or submit changes.

## Usage

1. Download the gitlab-clone-group.py
2. Generate a private access token with *read_api* and *read_repository* rights
3. Specify the "root" name of group. (after `gitlab.com`)
4. Run the script

### Example:

```
python3 gitlab-clone-group.py --token glabc-XXX "personal/services" .
```
